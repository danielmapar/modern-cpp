# C++ Nanodegree 

## Introduction to C++

* Standard Library
    * "The C++ Standard Library is a collection of classes and functions, which are written in the core language and part of the C++ ISO Standard itself." Wikipedia

    * Learning how to use the Standard Library is an important part of becoming a proficient C++ software engineer. In almost all cases, it is preferable to utilize functionality that already exists in the Standard Library, instead of implementing functionality from scratch. This is both because using the Standard Library is faster (it is well-documented) and because many expert software engineers have worked on the Standard Library. The performance of Standard Library facilities is optimized, robust, and almost always as fast or faster than an initial re-implementation of the same functionality.

    * In fact, guideline SL.1 of the [C++ Core Guidelines](http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines) is:
        * Use libraries wherever possible

        * Reason Save time. Donâ€™t re-invent the wheel. Donâ€™t replicate the work of others. Benefit from other peopleâ€™s work when they make improvements. Help other people when you make improvements.
    
    * And guideline SL.2 is:
        * Prefer the standard library to other libraries

        * Reason More people know the standard library. It is more likely to be stable, well-maintained, and widely available than your own code or most other libraries.

* Namespace
    * Standard Library functions and classes exist in the `std::` namespace. `std::vector`, for example, refers to the vector class within the Standard Library. Typically, in order to use a Standard Library feature we must both include the necessary header file (e.g. #include <vector>) and also namespace the class with `std::` (e.g. `std::vector`).

* Compilers

    * C++ is a compiled programming language, which means that programmers use a program to compile their human-readable source code into machine-readable object and executable files. The program that performs this task is called a compiler.

    * C++ does not have an "official" compiler. Instead, there are many different compilers that a programmer can use.

    * GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)

        * In this program we primarily use the GNU Compiler Collection, which is a popular, open-source, cross-platform compiler from the larger GNU Project. In particular, we use the `g++` program, which is a command line executable that compiles C++ source code and **automatically links the C++ Standard Library**.
    
    * Linking
        * ![linker](images/linker.png)

        * In order to use classes and functions from the C++ Standard Library, the compiler must have access to a compiled version of the standard library, stored in object files. Most compiler implementations, including GCC, **include those object files as part of the installation process**. In order to use the Standard Library facilities, the compiler must "link" the standard library object files to the object files created from the programmer's source code.

        * Once the compiler links together the necessary object files, it is able to generate a standalone executable file that can run on the operating system.

* Build Tools

    * Make and CMake are two separate and similar build tools that both serve to help simplify the process of building software.

    * In particular, build tools automate the process of compiling multiple source code files into object files, linking those object files together, and generating an executable. Build tools also often automate the process of determining which files have changed since the last build and thus need to be recompiled.

    * Make
        * [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/index.html#Top) is a widely-used build tool that relies on `Makefiles` to automate the process of building a project.

        * A `Makefile` typically includes one or more "targets". Each target performs a different action.

        * `build` is a common **target** name that is configured in the `Makefile` to compile all of the project's source code into an executable file. `clean`, on the other hand, is a common target to delete all object files and other artifacts of the build process, resulting in a clean, unbuilt project state.

        * Running either `make build` or `make clean` (or any other target) on the command line would cause `Make` to search for a local `Makefile`, search for a matching target within that Makefile, and then execute the target.
    
    * CMake

        * [CMake](https://cmake.org/) is a built tool that facilitates **cross-platform** builds, so that it is straightforward to build the same source code on Linux, macOS, Windows, or any other operating system. `CMake` relies on a CMakeLists.txt file, which configures appropriate cross-platform targets.

        * Building a `CMakeLists.txt` file can be a bit daunting, but `CMake` provides a helpful tutorial.

        * In this Nanodegree program, you will not need to build your own `Makefiles` or `CMakeLists.txt` files. We provide the appropriate configuration files for each project and instruct you as to their usage.

* Installation

    * You are welcome to write all of your code in Udacity's web-based Workspaces. If, however, you prefer to work locally on your machine, you will need to install certain software.

    * g++, gdb, make

        * MacOS

            * macOS includes g++ as part of Command Line Tools.

            * Launch Terminal, which can be found in the Utilities folder in Applications.
            * Type `xcode-select --install` into the Terminal window and press "Enter"
            * If you don't already have Xcode or Command Line Tools installed, a window will pop up. Press the Install button.
            * Verify: Type `g++` into Terminal and press enter. If the output is `clang: error: no input files`, then the installation was successful.    

        * Linux

            * These programs are typically available through the default package manager for each Linux distribution. For example, we can use APT on Ubuntu systems.

                * `sudo apt update`
                * `sudo apt install build-essential`
                * `sudo apt install gdb`
        
        * Windows

            * MinGW provides the necessary software.
                * Proceed from [Section 3.2](https://www.cs.odu.edu/~zeil/cs250PreTest/latest/Public/installingACompiler/#installing-the-mingw-compiler) of these linked instructions.

* Style

    * A consistent style (hopefully) helps improve and make your code more readable.

    * There are many different C++ styles, none of which is authoritative.

        * [Mozilla Coding Style: C/C++ practices](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Coding_Style#CC_practices)
    
    * ClangFormat

        * `clang-format` is a command line text formatter that automatically reformats source code according to configurable set of policies. The tool includes several pre-configured styles, or you can create your own.

        * `clang-format` is an open-source application that you can install on your system, or it is straightforward to install as a Visual Studio Code extension.  
            * `brew install clang-format`
        
* Debugging

    * Debugging is an important part of software development! Therefore, learning how to use a debugger is an important part of becoming a software developer ðŸ˜¬

    * Debuggers

        * Debuggers are tools that allow you to pause the execution of your code in various locations, inspect the state of the program, and step through your code line-by-line.

        * [GDB](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) and [LLDB](https://lldb.llvm.org/) are two popular, open-source debuggers for C++. Integrating them into a code editor often makes debugging easier.

        * In order to use Visual Studio Code's debugger with C++ files, you must install the free C/C++ extension.
            * Remember to compile your code with Symbols `-g` flag
                * `clang++ -std=c++20 -g hello.cpp -o a.out`
